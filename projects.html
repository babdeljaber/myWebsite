                    <div class="subtitle">Inspiration:</div>
                    <p class="ed_desc">EdUcate is inspired by the current events that are taking place around the world and the current lack of awareness people tend to have of those events. My team and I wanted to create something to help bridge the knowledge gap among the public and provide an avenue for change. The app specifically targets younger generations that either are not getting exposed to information or are getting it solely from social media platforms that can many times present biased information in an echo chamber. Our goal is to create a more educated and informed public while limiting the effects of media bias.</p>
                    <div class="subtitle">Development:</div>
                    <p class="ed_desc">First we developed a design and a goal for the application. We thought through each feature and drew a rough sketch of each page with a full Figma created for every page. Following this we created a repository in GitHub, which each team member cloned. We decided which features we were each going to work on and began coding. For the main feature of the application, we used a news api and integrated it into our project. For the login, the backend was created using Firebase. For the map feature, we used MapKit. After creating basic functionality, we modified the features to follow a consistent design scheme as outlined by our initial Figma. Then we worked on code documentation and fixing errors.</p>
